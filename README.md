# Vertigo Airlines - Airline Management System

This airline management system is developed to provide a comprehensive software solution for airline administrations. It addresses various real-life challenges encountered in airline operations. Users can expect an enhanced customer experience with the help of advanced algorithms and techniques.

## Project Objectives

* Create an airline management system that automates and optimizes various airline operations.
* Improve efficiency and streamline airline processes.
* Enhance customer experience through efficient management of airplane parking, pilot eligibility, weather routes, and airplane routes.
* Provide solutions that cater to different levels of difficulty, offering users choices and rewarding correct answers.

### Features of the Project

**Airplane Parking Solver:**
- Optimizes airplane parking to prevent collisions using the N-Queen Solving Technique.

**Pilot Eligibility Manager:**
- Matches pilots with specific airplane specifications using the m-coloring Solving Technique.

**Weather Route Analyzer:**
- Ensures passenger safety and comfort by avoiding routes with adverse weather conditions through an optimized Rat in a Maze Technique.

**Shortest Path Calculator:**
- Minimizes fuel consumption and optimizes routes for airplanes using an optimized version of The Dijkstra Algorithm.

### Algorithms Used

* N-Queen Solving Technique
* M-Coloring Solving Technique
* Rat in a Maze Technique
* The Dijkstra Algorithm
